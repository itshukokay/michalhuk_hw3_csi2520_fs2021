            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>Connecting people together is the most important aspect of technology to me, whether it be coworkers or friends and family. I firmly believe a successful business is only possible when employees can communicate quickly and efficiently, so that multiple departments can work together on goals towards the company’s mission. I am always interested in the latest consumer technology, whether pocket size or for vehicle systems. Technology plays an important role in every aspect of my life.</p>
